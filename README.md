Machine learning methods for categorization of hypersomnias/controls from PSG & MSLT data

This study was conducted at the Stanford Center for Sleep Sciences and Medicine. These are the files for implementation and analysis of stepwise multinomial logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, gradient boosting machine, and recursive partitioning and regression trees from a project assessing better diagnostic differentiation between controls (from Wisconsin Sleep Cohort), type 1 narcolepsy, type 2 narcolepsy, and idiopathic hypersomnia (latter 3 from the Stanford Narcolepsy Center database) based on features from the MSLT and preceding nocturnal polysomnogram.

The project improves the diagnosis of hypersomnia sleeping disorders from 70% to 95% accuracy and has since been presented at the American Academy of Neurology and Associated Professional Sleep Societies conferences.
